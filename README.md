# weekly-meetups

A Clojure application to get information about upcoming meetups that you care about. It will output a html string to do with what you will.

## DEPRECATED

This script is deprecated because unfortunately meetup.com no longer supports authentication via API key.

## Preparation

- Make sure you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed and running
- Create an account on [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com), login, and get your [API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)

## Usage

1. Set the following environment variables

   ```bash
   MEETUP_API_KEY=(Your API key from Meetup.com)
   MEETUP_CITY=(melbourne | brisbane | sydney)
   ```

2. Run `./batect run`
3. Open **output.html** to view the results
